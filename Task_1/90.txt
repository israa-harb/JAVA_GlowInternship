Notes on Interfaces in Java:
Like abstract classes, interfaces cannot be used to create objects (it is not possible to create an "Animal" object in the MyMainClass).
Interface methods do not have a body - the body is provided by the "implement" class.
On implementation of an interface, you must override all of its methods.
The interface methods are by default abstract and public.
Interface attributes are by default public, static and final.
An interface cannot contain a constructor.
Why And When To Use Interfaces?
To achieve security; hide certain details and only show the important details of an object.
