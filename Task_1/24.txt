More on recursion in java, we ask the following question: What is the difference between direct and indirect recursion?
A function fun is called a direct recursive if it calls the same function fun. A function fun is called an indirect recursive if it calls another function let's say fun_new and fun_new calls fun directly or indirectly. The difference between direct and indirect recursion can be concluded from the following example:

First is Direct recursion:

void directRecFun()
{
    // Some code....
    directRecFun();
    // Some code...
}
Second is Indirect recursion:

void indirectRecFun1()
{
    // Some code...
    indirectRecFun2();
    // Some code...
}

void indirectRecFun2()
{
    // Some code...
    indirectRecFun1();
    // Some code...
}
