String Concatenation: the + operator can be used between strings to combine them. This is called concatenation.
Example:
String firstName = "John";
String lastName = "Doe";
System.out.println(firstName + " " + lastName);
Note that we have added an empty text (" ") to create space between firstName and lastName on print.

The concat() method is used to concatenate two strings.
Example:
String firstName = "John ";
String lastName = "Doe";
System.out.println(firstName.concat(lastName));

Java uses the + operator for both addition and concatenation. Numbers are added. Strings are concatenated.

If you add two numbers, the result will be a number, example:
int x = 10;
int y = 20;
int z = x + y;  // z will be 30
