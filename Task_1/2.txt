Object-Oriented Programming involves classes and objects. A class serves as a template for objects, while an object is an instance of a class. When an object is created, it inherits all the variables and methods from the class. Since we can define variables and methods in a class, the objects created from this class can use the same variables and methods. A car class has attributes like weight and color, with methods like drive and brake. Different brands of cars can be created as objects from this class, like Toyota, BMW. They share basic functionalities but differ in attribute values
