Continueing the previous example which is on printFun: the remaining statements of printFun(1) are executed and it returns to printFun(2) and so on. In the output, values from 3 to 1 are printed and then 1 to 3 are printed.  So the final output is 3 2 1 1 2 3 .
The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.
