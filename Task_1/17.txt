Explaining the previous example of using recursion for adding numbers: When the sum() function is called, it adds parameter k to the sum of all numbers smaller than k and returns the result. When this k becomes 0, the function just returns 0. When running, the program follows these steps:

10 + sum(9)
10 + ( 9 + sum(8) )
10 + ( 9 + ( 8 + sum(7) ) )
...
10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + sum(0)
10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0
Since the function does not call itself when k is 0, the program stops there and returns the result.
