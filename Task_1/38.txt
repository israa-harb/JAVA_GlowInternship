More on java numbers, or more specifically primitive numbers. Primitive number types are divided into two groups: First kind is integer types which  stores whole numbers, positive or negative (such as 123 or -456), without decimals. Valid types are byte, short, int and long. Which type you should use, depends on the numeric value. Floating point types represents numbers with a fractional part, containing one or more decimals. There are two types: float and double. Even though there are many numeric types in Java, the most used for numbers are int (for whole numbers) and double (for floating point numbers).
