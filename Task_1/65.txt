Java Strings: are used for storing text. A String variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes. For example:
//Create a variable of type String and assign it a value
String greeting = "Hello"
A String in Java is actually an object, which contain methods that can perform certain operations on strings. The length of a string can be found with the length() method. Example:
String txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
System.out.println("The length of the txt string is: " + txt.length());

There are many string methods available, for example indexOf() (which returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified text in string)
