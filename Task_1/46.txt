More on the If Statement: use the if statement to specify a block of Java code to be executed if a condition is true. Take the following example:
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
Note that "if" is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (If or IF) will generate an error.
In the example below, we test two values to find out if 20 is greater than 18. If the condition is true, print some text. Take the following example:
if (20 > 18) {
  System.out.println("20 is indeed greater than 18, so the condition is true");
}
