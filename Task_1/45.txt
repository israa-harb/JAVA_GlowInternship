Java Conditions and If Statements: Java supports the usual logical conditions.
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
Equal to a == b
Not Equal to: a != b
Java has the following conditional statements:
Use if to execute a code block if a condition is true.
Use else to execute a code block if the same condition is false.
Use else if to specify new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
