Java Multi-line Comments: consider we want to write multiple comments instead of writing before every comment line //, we write /* before the first line comment and then */ after the last line comment. Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */. Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by Java.

This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:
/* This code will print the words Hello World
to the screen, and it is amazing */
System.out.println("Hello World");

Single or multi-line comments?
It is up to you which you want to use. Normally, we use // for short comments, and /* */ for longer.
