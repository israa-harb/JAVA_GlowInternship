Java Polymorphism: it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance. Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows the performmance of single action in different ways.

For example, think of a superclass called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). Subclasses of Animals could be Pigs, Dogs, and they have their own implementation of an animal sound :
class Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    System.out.println("animal makes sound");
  }
}

class Pig extends Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    System.out.println("oink");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    System.out.println("woof");
  }
}
