Note: constructor name must match class name, and it cannot have a return type (like void). The constructor is called when the object is created. All classes have constructors by default: if you do not create a class constructor yourself, Java creates one for you. However, then you are not able to set initial values for object attributes. Constructors can also take parameters, which is used to initialize attributes.
public class Main {
  int modelYear;
  String modelName;

  public Main(int year, String name) {
    modelYear = year;
    modelName = name;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myCar = new Main(1969, "Mustang");
    System.out.println(myCar.modelYear + " " + myCar.modelName);
  }
}

// Outputs 1969 Mustang
