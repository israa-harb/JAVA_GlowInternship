Double quotes: when you are working with text, it must be wrapped inside double quotations marks "". If you forget the double quotes, an error occurs, for example:
System.out.println("This sentence will work fine!");
System.out.println(This sentence will produce an error);

The Print() Method: there is also a print() method, which is similar to println(). The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output, cosider the following example:
System.out.print("Hello World! ");
System.out.print("This sentence is on the same line.");
Note that we add an extra space (after "Hello World! " in the example above), for better readability.
