1. Arithmetic Operators: they are used to perform simple arithmetic operations on primitive data types. 
* : Multiplication
/ : Division
% : Modulo
+ : Addition
â€“ : Subtraction

// Arithmetic Operators
import java.io.*;
class GFG {
      // Main Function
    public static void main (String[] args) {
           
        // Arithmetic operators
        int a = 10;
        int b = 3;
       
        System.out.println("a + b = " + (a + b));
        System.out.println("a - b = " + (a - b));
        System.out.println("a * b = " + (a * b));
        System.out.println("a / b = " + (a / b));
        System.out.println("a % b = " + (a % b));
           
    }
}
