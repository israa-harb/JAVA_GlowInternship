Loops in Java: loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached. Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.
Java While Loop: the while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. Consider the following example for the syntax:
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}

In the example below, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 5:
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;
}
