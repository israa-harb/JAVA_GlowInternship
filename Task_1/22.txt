Explanation of the previous example, when printFun(3) is called from main(), memory is allocated to printFun(3), local variable test is initialized to 3, and statements 1 to 4 are pushed on the stack as shown below diagram. It first prints ‘3’. In statement 2, printFun(2) is called and memory is allocated to printFun(2), a local variable test is initialized to 2, and statements 1 to 4 are pushed in the stack. Similarly, printFun(2) calls printFun(1) and printFun(1) calls printFun(0). printFun(0) goes to if statement and it return to printFun(1). The explanation and the output is continued in the next file.
