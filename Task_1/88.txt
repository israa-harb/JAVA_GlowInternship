Abstract Classes and Methods: data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to user.
Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces.
The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods. Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class). Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it doesnt have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from). An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods.
