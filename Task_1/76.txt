A multidimensional array is an array of arrays. Used to store data as a tabular form, like tables, matrix. To create a two-dimensional array, add each array within its own set of curly braces.
Example:
int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} };
myNumbers is array with two arrays as its elements.

To access the elements of the myNumbers array, specify two indexes: one for the array, and one for element inside array. This example accesses the third element (2) in the second array (1) of myNumbers:
int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} };
System.out.println(myNumbers[1][2]); // Outputs 7
