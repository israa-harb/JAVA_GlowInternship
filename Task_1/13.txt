As we mentioned before that a block of code refers to all of the code between curly braces {}. Take for example:
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Code here CANNOT use x

    { // This is a block

      // Code here CANNOT use x

      int x = 100;

      // Code here CAN use x
      System.out.println(x);

    } // The block ends here

  // Code here CANNOT use x

  }
}
A block of code may exist on its own or it can belong to an if, while or for statement. In the case of for statements, variables declared in the statement itself are also available inside the block's scope.
