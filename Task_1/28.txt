Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.
Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//). Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed, so basically we can write anything inside it).

The following example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:
// This is a comment
System.out.println("Hello World");

The following example uses a single-line comment at the end of a line of code:
System.out.println("Hello World"); // This is a comment that does nothing
