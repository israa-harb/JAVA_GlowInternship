Stack Overflow error happens if the base case is not reached or not defined, then the stack overflow problem may arise. Let us take an example to understand this.

int fact(int n)
{
    // wrong base case (it may cause stack overflow).
    if (n == 100) 
        return 1;
    else
        return n*fact(n-1);
}
If fact(10) is called, it will call fact(9), fact(8), fact(7), fact(6) and so on but the number will never reach 100. So we conclude that the base case is not reached which is wrong. If the memory is exhausted by these functions on the stack, it will cause a stack overflow error.
