Creating classes in java is as follows:
public class Main {
  int x = 10;
}
//This class  has the name "Main' with a variable x.
Creating objects: In Java, an object is created from a class. We have already created the class named Main, so now we can use this to create objects.

To create an object of Main, specify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword new:

public class Main {
  int x = 5;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}
// we created an object called "myObj" and printed the value of the x
