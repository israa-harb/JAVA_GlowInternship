Static vs. Public: A static method means that it can be accessed without creating an object of the class, unlike public, which can only be accessed by objects. An example to demonstrate the differences between static and public methods:
public class Main {
  // Static method
  static void myStaticMethod() {
    System.out.println("Static methods can be called without creating objects");
  }

  // Public method
  public void myPublicMethod() {
    System.out.println("Public methods must be called by creating objects");
  }

  // Main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myStaticMethod(); // Call static method
    // myPublicMethod(); This would compile error

    Main myObj = new Main(); // Create an object of Main
    myObj.myPublicMethod(); // Call  public method on the object
  }
}
