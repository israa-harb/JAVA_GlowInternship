The ArrayList class has many methods. For example, to add elements to the ArrayList, use the add() method. To access an element in the ArrayList, use the get() method and refer to the index number. To modify an element, use the set() method and refer to the index number. To remove an element, use the remove() method and refer to the index number. To remove all the elements in the ArrayList, use the clear() method. Loop through the elements of an ArrayList with a for loop, and use the size() method to specify how many times the loop should run.
