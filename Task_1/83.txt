2. Private Access Modifier: specified using keyword private. The methods or data members declared as private are accessible only within the class in which they are declared. Any other class of the same package will not be able to access these members.Top-level classes or interfaces can not be declared as private because private means “only visible within the enclosing class”, and protected means “only visible within the enclosing class and any subclasses”.
3. Protected Access Modifier: specified using the keyword protected. The methods or data members declared as protected are accessible within the same package or subclasses in different packages.
