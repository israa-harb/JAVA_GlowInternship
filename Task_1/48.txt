Example on the else statement:
int time = 20;
if (time < 18) {
  System.out.println("Good day.");
} else {
  System.out.println("Good evening.");
}
// Outputs "Good evening."
In this example, time (20) > 18, so the condition is false. We proceed to else condition and print "Good evening" to the screen.

The else if Statement: use it to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

Syntax
if (condition1) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
