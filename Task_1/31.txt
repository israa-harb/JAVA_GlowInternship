To create a variable in java, you must specify the type and assign it a value:
type variableName = value;
Where type is one of Java's types (such as int or String), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.

To create a variable that should store text, look at the following example:
Create a variable called name of type String and assign the value "John":
String name = "John";
System.out.println(name);

To create a variable that should store a number, for example:
int myNum = 15;
System.out.println(myNum);
