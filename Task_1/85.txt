Getters and Setters: private variables can only be accessed within the same class (an outside class has no access to it). However, it is possible to access them if we provide public get and set methods. The get method returns the variable value, and the set method sets the value.
Syntax for both is that they start with either get or set, followed by the name of the variable, with the first letter in upper case:

For Example:
public class Person {
  private String name; // private = restricted access

  // Getter
  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }

  // Setter
  public void setName(String newName) {
    this.name = newName;
  }
}
