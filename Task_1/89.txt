Interfaces: another way to achieve abstraction in Java, is with interfaces. An interface is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies:
interface Animal {
  public void animalSound(); // interface method (doesnt have body)
  public void run(); // interface method (doesnt have body)
}
 
To access the interface methods, the interface must be "implemented" by another class with the "implements" keyword. The body of the interface method is provided by the "implement" class:
// Pig implements the Animal interface
class Pig implements Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    // body of animalSound() provided 
    System.out.println("oink");
  }
  public void sleep() {
    // body of sleep() provided 
    System.out.println("Zzz");
  }
}
