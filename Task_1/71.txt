There is also a "for-each" loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array.
Syntax:
for (type variableName : arrayName) {
  // code block to be executes
}
The following example outputs all elements in the cars array, using a "for-each" loop.
Example:
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda", "Mercedes"};
for (String i : cars) {
  System.out.println(i);
}

Java Break: used to "jump out" of a switch statement. The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop. This example stops the loop when i is equal to 4:

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 4) {
    break;
  }
  System.out.println(i);
}
