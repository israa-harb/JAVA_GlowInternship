Enums: an enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables). To create an enum, use the enum keyword (instead of class or interface), and separate the constants with a comma. Note that they should be in uppercase letters.
Example:
enum Level {
  LOW,
  MEDIUM,
  HIGH
}
You can access enum constants with the dot syntax: Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM;
You can also have an enum inside a class.
Enums are often used in switch statements to check for corresponding values.
The enum type has a values() method, which returns an array of all enum constants.
