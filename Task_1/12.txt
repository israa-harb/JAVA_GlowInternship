In Java, variables are only accessible inside the region they are created. This is called scope. Variables declared directly inside a method are available anywhere in the method following the line of code in which they were declared, for example:
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Code CANNOT use x

    int x = 100;

    // Code here can use x
    System.out.println(x);
  }
}
A block of code refers to all of the code between curly braces {}. Variables declared inside blocks of code are only accessible by the code between the curly braces, which follows the line in which the variable was declared.
