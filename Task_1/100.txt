Java has several methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files. The File class from the java.io package, allows us to work with files. To use the File class, create an object of the class, and specify the filename or directory name.
import java.io.File;  
File myObj = new File("filename.txt"); 

Methods of File Class:
canRead(): Tests whether the file is readable or not
canWrite(): Tests whether the file is writable or not
createNewFile(): Creates an empty file
delete(): Deletes a file
exists(): Tests whether the file exists.
length():Returns the size of file (bytes).
list():Returns an array of the files in the directory
