More on parameters, a method can use if...else statements inside it, for example:
public class Main {

  // We create a checkAge() method with an integer variable called age
  static void checkAge(int age) {

    // If the age is less than 18, print "access denied"
    if (age < 18) {
      System.out.println("Access denied - You are not old enough!");

    // If the age is greater than, or equal to, 18, print "access granted"
    } else {
      System.out.println("Access granted - You are old enough!");
    }

  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    checkAge(20); // Call the checkAge method and pass along an age of 20
  }
}

// The output is : "Access granted - You are old enough!"
