Another example on the else if statement explained before:
int time = 22;
if (time < 10) {
  System.out.println("Good morning.");
} else if (time < 18) {
  System.out.println("Good day.");
} else {
  System.out.println("Good evening.");
}
// The output will be "Good evening."
In the example above, time (22) is greater than 10, so the first condition is false. The next condition, in the else if statement, is also false, so we move on to the else condition since condition1 and condition2 is both false, so the output printed on the screen is the "Good evening".

However, if we suppose that  the time was 14, our program would print "Good day."
