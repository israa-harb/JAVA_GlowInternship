Java HashMap: a HashMap stores items in "key/value" pairs, and you can access them by an index of another type (e.g. a String).
One object is used as a key (index) to another object (value). It can store different types: String keys and Integer values, or the same type, like: String keys and String values:
Create a HashMap object called capitalCities that will store String keys and String values:
import java.util.HashMap; //  we import the HashMap class
HashMap<String, String> capitalCities = new HashMap<String, String>();
The HashMap class has many useful methods. For example, to add items to it, use the put() method.
