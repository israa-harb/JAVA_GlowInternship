Java Arrays: used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets:
String[] cars;
We have now declared a variable that holds an array of strings. To insert values to it, you can place the values in a comma-separated list, inside curly braces:
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
To create an array of integers, you could write:
int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};
Access the Elements of an Array: we can access an array element by referring to the index number.
