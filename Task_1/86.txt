Java Inheritance: it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class, and the superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from.
To inherit from a class, use "extends" keyword.

class Vehicle {
  protected String brand = "Ford";        // Vehicle attribute
  public void honk() {                    // Vehicle method
    System.out.println("Tuut!");
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  private String modelName = "Mustang";    // Car attribute
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Create a myCar object
    Car myCar = new Car();

    // Call the honk() method (from the Vehicle class) on the myCar object
    myCar.honk();
  }
}
