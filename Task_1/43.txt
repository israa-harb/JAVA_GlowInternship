A Boolean expression returns a boolean value: true or false. This is useful to build logic, and find answers. For example, you can use a comparison operator, such as the greater than (>) operator, to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true or false.
Example:
int x = 10;
int y = 9;
System.out.println(x > y); // returns true, because 10 > 9
//Or even easier:
System.out.println(10 > 9); // returns true, because 10 > 9

In the examples below, we use the equal to (==) operator to evaluate an expression
int x = 10;
System.out.println(x == 10); // returns true, because the value of x is equal to 10
