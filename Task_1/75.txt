Loop Through an Array: you can loop through the array elements with the for loop, and use the length property to specify how many times the loop should run.
The following example outputs all elements in the cars array:
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
for (int i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  System.out.println(cars[i]);
}

There is also a "for-each" loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in arrays.
The Syntax:
for (type variable : arrayname) {
  ...
}
The following example outputs all elements in the cars array, using a "for-each" loop:
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
for (String i : cars) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
