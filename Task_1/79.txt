Access Methods With an Object: create a Car object named myCar. Call the fullThrottle() and speed() methods on the myCar object, and run the program:
// Main class
public class Main {
 
  //  fullThrottle() method
  public void fullThrottle() {
    System.out.println("The car is going as fast as it can!");
  }

  //speed() method and add a parameter
  public void speed(int maxSpeed) {
    System.out.println("Max speed: " + maxSpeed);
  }

  // Inside main, call the methods on the myCar object
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myCar = new Main();   // Create a myCar object
    myCar.fullThrottle();      // Call the fullThrottle() method
    myCar.speed(200);          // Call speed() method
  }
}

// The car is going as fast as it can!
// Max speed: 200
