Multiple Variables, we can declare more than one variable of the same type, to do so we use a comma-separated list.
Take the following example, where instead of writing:
int x = 5;
int y = 6;
int z = 50;
int w = 1
System.out.println(x + y + z + w);
You can simply write:
int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50, w = 1;
System.out.println(x + y + z + w); //less code

One Value to Multiple Variables: you can also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line, take the following example:
int x, y, z, w;
x = y = z = w = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z + w);
