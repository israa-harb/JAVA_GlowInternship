 Recursion provides a way to break the complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.  An example on java recursion, if we consider the case of adding two numbers which is easy to do, but adding a range of numbers is more complicated. In the following example, recursion is used to add a range of numbers together by breaking it down into the simple task of adding two numbers:
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int result = sum(10);
    System.out.println(result);
  }
  public static int sum(int k) {
    if (k > 0) {
      return k + sum(k - 1);
    } else {
      return 0;
    }
  }
}
