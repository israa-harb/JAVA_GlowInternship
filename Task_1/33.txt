The println() method is often used to display variables. "+" character is used to combine text and a variable:
String name = "John";
System.out.println("Hello " + name);

We use the + character to add a variable to another variable:
String firstName = "John ";
String lastName = "Doe";
String fullName = firstName + lastName;
System.out.println(fullName);

For numeric values, the + character works as a mathematical operator:
int x = 5;
int y = 6;
System.out.println(x + y); // Print the value of x + y

From the example above, you can expect:

x stores the value 5
y stores the value 6
We use the println() method to add x and y
The output is 11
