The last integer type is:
4.Long: the long data type can store whole numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. This is used when int is not large enough to store the value. Note that you should end the value with an "L":
long myNum = 15000000000L;
System.out.println(myNum);

Floating Point Types: you should usually use a floating point type whenever you need a number with a decimal, such as 9.99 or 3.14515.The float and double data types can store fractional numbers. Note that you should end the value with an "f" for floats and "d" for doubles, for example:
float myNum = 5.75f;
System.out.println(myNum);
