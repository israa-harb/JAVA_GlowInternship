Java is a widely known programming language that has a large demand in the job market. In my personal opinion, it is one of the easier programming languages today. Having learned the C language at my university, Java feels much smoother. Java is an object-oriented programming language, allowing us to create objects with both data and methods. Object-oriented programming makes code shorter and more efficient. It follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle, meaning common code should be placed in a single location and reused. Additionally, Java's platform independence enables developers to write code once and run it on any platform, making it highly versatile.
