Java also has a block of code that is called method, which runs only when it is called, just like a function. We can pass data, known as parameters, into a method. They are used to perform certain actions. A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses. For example:
public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    // method is called "myMethod", it is created inside in the class
    //static: the method belongs to the Main class and not an object of the Main class.
    //void: it doesn't return a value.
  }
}
