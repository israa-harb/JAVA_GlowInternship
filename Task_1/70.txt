Java For Loop:
When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop. Syntax:
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
Nested Loops: is when we place a loop inside another loop. The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop", for example:
// Outer loop
for (int i = 1; i <= 2; i++) {
  System.out.println("Outer: " + i); // Executes 2 times
  // Inner loop
  for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
    System.out.println(" Inner: " + j); // Executes 6 times (2 * 3)
  }
}
