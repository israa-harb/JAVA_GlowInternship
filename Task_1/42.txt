In java we have the boolean data type. Very often, in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like:
YES / NO
ON / OFF
TRUE / FALSE
For this, Java has a boolean data type, which can store true or false values.
A boolean type is declared with the boolean keyword and can only take the values true or false. Take the following example:
boolean isJavaFun = true;
boolean isFishTasty = false;
System.out.println(isJavaFun);     // The output is true
System.out.println(isFishTasty);   // The output is  false
However, its more common to return boolean values from boolean expressions, for conditional testing.
