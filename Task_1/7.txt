Java provides some pre-defined methods, such as System.out.println(), but we can also create your own methods to perform certain actions. To call a method in Java, write the method's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon. In the following example, myMethod() is used to print a text (the action), when it is called:

public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("I just got executed!");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod();
  }
}
 // in this code we called the mymethod() method from inside the main
 // the output is: "I just got executed!"

We also note that a method can be called multiple times.
