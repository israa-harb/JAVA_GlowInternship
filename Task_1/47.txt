We can also test variables.
int x = 20;
int y = 18;
if (x > y) {
  System.out.println("x is greater than y");
}
In the example above we use two variables, x and y, to test whether x is greater than y. We know that 20 is indeed greater than 18, we print to the screen that "x is greater than y".

The else Statement: use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if the condition is false
}
