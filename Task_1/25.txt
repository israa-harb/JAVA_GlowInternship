Java syntax:
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Main. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter. The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename. To run the example above on your computer, make sure that Java is properly installed, which we will talk about later. The output should be:

Hello World
