Example on the double data type:
double myNum = 19.99d;
System.out.println(myNum);

We often ask ourselves the question, do we use float or double?The precision of a floating point value indicates how many digits the value can have after the decimal point. The precision of float is only six or seven decimal digits, while double variables have a precision of about 15 digits. Therefore it is safer to use double for most calculations.

Scientific Numbers: floating point number can also be a scientific number with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.
Example:
float f1 = 35e3f;
double d1 = 12E4d;
System.out.println(f1);
System.out.println(d1);
